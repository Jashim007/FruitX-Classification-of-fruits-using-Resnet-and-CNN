# FruitX-Classification-of-fruits-using-Resnet-and-CNN
In the proposed research, we propose a fruit classification system using two popular deep learning frameworks, CNN and ResNet50. Both the models performed exceptionally well on the network architectures, where the test accuracy achieved by CNN and ResNet50 V2 was 97.48\% and 98.89\% respectively, therefore obtaining a state of the art results when compared to related works on the similar dataset. The training directory was augmented, and a validation set of 12\% was set to produce consistent and reliable results. A number of evaluation parameters like Precision, Sensitivity, F-Scores, and ROC were calculated to analyze the results obtained. Furthermore, we took advantage of a predictor model to visualize the results on a test set with 3,615 images. The ResNet50 V2 model produced remarkable results and was more accurate, we call this model, the FruitX.
